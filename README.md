❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App
A machine learning web application that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health parameters, built using Logistic Regression and deployed with Streamlit.

🔗 Live App: https://your-app-name.streamlit.app

📌 Overview
This project uses the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to train a classification model that predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on 13 clinical features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type.

🚀 Features
Clean, interactive web interface built with Streamlit
Real-time prediction with probability score
Data preprocessing pipeline: duplicate removal, outlier handling (IQR method), invalid category filtering
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Logistic Regression model with ~80% test accuracy
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas / NumPy – data cleaning and preprocessing
Scikit-learn – model training (Logistic Regression)
Streamlit – web app framework
📊 Dataset
UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset — 13 clinical features including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and more.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Removed duplicate records
Removed invalid category values (thal = 0, ca = 4)
Removed outliers using the IQR method on continuous columns
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
